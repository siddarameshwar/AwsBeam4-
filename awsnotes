Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity
in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
How Amazon EC2 works
========================================================================
(1) Launch
First, you launch an instance. Begin by selecting a template with basic configurations for
your instance. These configurations include the operating system, application server, or
applications. You also select the instance type, which is the specific hardware configuration
of your instance.
As you are preparing to launch an instance, you specify security settings to control the
network traffic that can flow into and out of your instance. Later in this course, we will
explore Amazon EC2 security features in greater detail.
========================================================================
(2) Connect
Next, connect to the instance. You can connect to the instance in several ways. Your
programs and applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the
instance and exchange data. Users can also connect to the instance by logging in and
accessing the computer desktop.
============================================================================
(3) Use
After you have connected to the instance, you can begin using it. You can run commands to
install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.
===========================================================
Multi-tenancy
EC2 runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization
technology. When you spin up an EC2 instance, you aren't necessarily taking an entire host
to yourself. Instead, you are sharing the host with multiple other instances, otherwise
known as virtual machines. And a hypervisor running on the host machine is responsible for
sharing the underlying physical resources between the virtual machines



























General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking
resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
 application servers
 gaming servers
 backend servers for enterprise applications
 small and medium databases
====================================================================
Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from
high-performance processors. Like general purpose instances, you can use compute
optimized instances for workloads such as web, application, and gaming servers.
====================================================================================
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that
process large datasets in memory. In computing, memory is a temporary storage area. It
holds all the data and instructions that a central processing unit (CPU) needs to be able to
complete actions. Before a computer program or application is able to run, it is loaded from
storage into memory. This preloading process gives the CPU direct access to the computer
program.
==========================================================================
Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform
some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Examples of
these functions include floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data
pattern matching.
======================================================================================
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read
and write access to large datasets on local storage. Examples of workloads suitable for
storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing
applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
===============================================================================
On-Demand Instances are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be
interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously
until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.
===============================================================================
reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in
your account, and these are suited for steady-state workloads or ones with predictable
usage. You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year
or 3-year term, and Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. You realize greater cost
savings with the 3-year option.
==================================================================================
spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can
withstand interruptions. They allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity
for up to 90% off of the On-Demand price. The catch here is that AWS can reclaim the
instance at any time they need it, giving you a two-minute warning to finish up work and
save state. You can always resume later if needed. So when choosing Spot Instances, make
sure your workloads can tolerate being interrupted. A good example of those are batch
workloads.
===========================================================================
Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully
dedicated to your use. These are usually for meeting certain compliance requirements and
nobody else will share tenancy of that host.


Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 
instances in response to changing application demand. By automatically scaling your 
instances in and out as needed, you are able to maintain a greater sense of application 
availability.
Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and 
predictive scaling.
 Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand.
 Predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances 
based on predicted demand.

Elastic Load Balancing
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming 
application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto 
Scaling group. This means that as you add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to 
the amount of incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first. Then, the 
requests spread across multiple resources that will handle them. For example, if you have 
multiple Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing distributes the workload across the 
multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it


VPC
A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources
is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
A VPC, or Virtual Private Cloud, is essentially your own private network in AWS. A VPC
allows you to define your private IP range for your AWS resources, and you place things like
EC2 instances and ELBs inside of your VPC. Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated
section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual
network that you define. These resources can be public facing so they have access to the
internet, or private with no internet access, usually for backend services like databases or
application servers.
Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets.
A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
Subnets are chunks of IP addresses in your VPC that allow you to group resources together


AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private 
connection between your data centre and a VPC.
